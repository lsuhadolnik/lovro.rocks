My company is a fine little place, where everyone does what they must. It is a place where people feel so at home. And not only the employees but also our customers. When you enter the main office, our accountant interviews you about your living, you can even eat some food there and if you are especially lucky, somebody comes around and offers you a drink. Everybody got very used to this rhythm. You know however that such comfort makes people lazy and our place is no exception.

THE topic, that everyone has to say so much about (let’s rather say complain) is our Dynamics CRM application. I am a very lucky man since I am in charge of keeping it in shape. Every time the system decides not to function or slows down, you can hear a “Lovrooo” call across the rooms. Usually, I only have to advise them about the right way of doing the task they attempted to accomplish, yet sometimes it gets even more interesting.

There is an important factor in this story - it’s my coworker (let’s call him Mycroft). He is a systems engineer. He constantly happens to run into bugs, that no one else ever would. And not only he is especially keen on finding these pesky animals, he is also a ‘professional’ UX consultant. Whenever there is a possibility not to make one more click in order to finish the task, he keeps complaining about it so much, that one finds or develops a shortcut for him.

## My place

Just so you imagine… Our office has 2 sections: the service section and the sales section. When you enter, you come to the accounting room. If you turn to the right, you come to the sales room. There are several people including myself. Right behind me, there is a little kitchen and a bar, with movable white seats. People come here, they take a seat and talk. That enables me to get informed about everything that happens in the company. Especially usual are personal things, but the most common thing is complaining.

Another day I was in the office, Mycroft came to me and told me how hard his life was. I asked him, what the matter was and he said that he had a tremendous amount of work to do and after everything he does, he also has to enter all the work he has done into the CRM.

I looked at him and thought for myself, what did I break this time. I asked him, what in his opinion was the most time-consuming task he had to perform. He laughed and said: “Ha, using the CRM itself”. Then he started to explain to me in details what was the last thing he has done and how hard it was to enter the data.

When I listen to anyone, I always look them into eyes. This is especially hard when you try not to smile at the same time. Mycroft noticed me smiling and said: what, you don’t believe me? Come over, I will show you. So I came over to his office and watched him repeat the process in front of my eyes. After he did what he wanted, he turned at me and said: “You see? I have to do this all the time….”

I told him, that everyone else has to do the same and that it actually isn’t so long process. I showed him some little tricks, that saved some clicks, but he still wouldn’t listen. Luckily, another coworker heard us and said that it really is not that much to do and helped me to calm him down. He said: Ok, ok.. you won, but how come can’t anybody understand me?

And then the story began. Now he comes to me several times a week and tells me about every little thing that bugs him. Sometimes I just explain to him what to do, sometimes I set up a new feature that I (and my boss) find useful for the whole team. Some of them are interesting enough to put them here for you to read.

## To sum things up

So the silence around my place ended. Since I had this meeting with Mycroft I keep getting new ideas to implement in our Dynamics CRM. This post is a starting point just so you know the context. You are invited to check the blog for new interesting stories and ideas.

I am also looking forward to hearing from you!

Thanks.
